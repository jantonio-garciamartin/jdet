		<center><h2><i>JDet</i><br>Known bugs</h2></center>
		<hr>
		<p>
		Currently the following bugs have been detected in JDet.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Drag and drop files doesn't work in OSX.
			</li>
			<li>
				Several error detected in linux with more than one display: Maximization and resizing dimensions are wrong and java3D dependent windows will not load in the secondary display.
			</li>
			
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Fixed bugs (bugs are named for the version in which they were detected, therefore they were fixed in the next version):
		<ul>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.8: S3Det could produce nonsense results in some very specific cases. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.7: S3det does not accept more than one parameter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.6: Search for structures not working because NCBI BLAST refuses non HTTPs connections.<br/>
				               S3det and xDet executable permissions not copied in ant build.<br/>
                                               Incompatibilities of S3det executable for Linux i646 
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.5: S3det executable for Linux i646 not working for some linux distributions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.4: When maximizing the alignment window instead of resizing, sequences at the end of the alignment out of the scope of the minimized window are not shown.
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.3: The bug described for version 1.4.2 is still present when pdb files are loaded directly from pdb site. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Version 1.4.2: Structure alignments are based in the primary sequence of PDB files (SEQRES tag). Since structure information not always matches with the primary sequence, <b>selected residues could differ between alignment and structure view </b>. Please check that residues in your selection are correct while this bug is fixed.  
			</li>

			<li>
				Version 1.4.1: Blast against RSBC webservices is no longer supported by RSBC. Since version 1.4.2 blast is performed against NCBI servers 
			</li>
		</ul>
